# UFOSightingProject
While analyzing this dataset of over 80000 reported global UFO sightings, I encountered difficult due to a large quantity of null values in the 'country' column, as well as inconsistencies in the format of coountry codes. I created dictionaries (see 'mappings.py') to refer to not only for standardization of values, but also to fill in the blanks for those with related countries/provinces. I used AWS Amazon Location Services for reverse geocoding in order to fill in additional missing values based on longitude and latitude. Additionally, I reassigned names and dropped rows to address nulls in other categories, with the goal of improving uniformity of the dataset for data analysis and future visualization projects
